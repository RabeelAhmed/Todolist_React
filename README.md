Todo List Application
On my learning journey of the MERN stack, I developed this Todo List application using React.js to deepen my skills in state management, local storage, and modern JavaScript practices.
📖 Project Overview
The Todo List Application is a user-friendly tool that allows individuals to manage their tasks effectively. It supports adding new tasks, editing existing ones, deleting individual tasks, and clearing all tasks. The application leverages the browser's local storage to persist data across page reloads, ensuring a seamless user experience.

🌟 Features
Task Management: Easily add, edit, and delete tasks.
Persistent Data: Tasks are stored in local storage for data persistence.
Dynamic Button Functionality: Switches between add and edit modes based on user interaction.
Clear All Tasks: Option to remove all tasks with a single click.
Responsive Design: Ensures a consistent experience across different devices.
🛠️ Technologies Used
React.js: The core library for building the user interface and managing state.
Local Storage: For saving and retrieving tasks data.
JavaScript ES6+: Utilizes modern JavaScript features for a clean and efficient codebase.
CSS: Custom styles to enhance the application's look and feel.
FontAwesome: Icons for interactive elements like edit and delete buttons.
📚 Key Learnings
This project provided valuable experience in:

State Management: Using useState to handle and update application state.
Effect Hook: Employing useEffect to manage side effects such as data persistence.
Conditional Rendering: Dynamically rendering components based on application state.
Component-Based Architecture: Structuring the application into reusable React components.
