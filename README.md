Todo List Application
On my learning journey of MERN, I built this Todo List application using React.js to enhance my understanding of state management, local storage integration, and modern JavaScript practices.
📝 Project Description
This Todo List Application allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage a list of tasks. The app persists the tasks locally using the browser's local storage, ensuring the list remains available even after a page reload. Users can seamlessly add new tasks, edit existing ones, and remove tasks individually or all at once.

🚀 Features
Add New Tasks: Users can input text to add a new task to the list.
Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks by clicking the edit icon next to a task.
Delete Tasks: Delete individual tasks using the trash icon.
Remove All Tasks: Clear the entire list with a single button.
Data Persistence: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist after a page refresh.
Responsive UI: A clean and responsive design that works across different devices.
Dynamic Button Rendering: The app dynamically switches between adding and editing tasks based on user interaction.
🛠️ Technologies Used
React.js: The core library used for building the UI components and managing the application state.
Local Storage: Used to store and persist the user's todo list in the browser.
JavaScript ES6+: Modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and the spread operator for cleaner code.
CSS: Custom styling to enhance the application's layout and design.
FontAwesome: Icons for edit and delete buttons to improve user interaction.
📚 Key Learnings
This project helped me dive deeper into the following concepts:

State Management: Using useState to handle dynamic data and user inputs.
Effect Hook: Leveraging useEffect for side effects like saving data to local storage.
Conditional Rendering: Showing different buttons (add/edit) based on the state of the task being interacted with.
Component-Based Architecture: Structuring the UI with reusable and maintainable React components.
